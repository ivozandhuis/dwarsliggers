# Dwarsliggers

This repo contains data and accompanying scripts in R, Python3 and SQL, transforming, visualizing and analysing the data. It is part of my PhD-project "Dwarsliggers: Motieven om te staken bij de Centrale Werkplaats in Haarlem tijdens de spoorwegstakingen van 1903" (in Dutch, [http://hdl.handle.net/1765/129483](http://hdl.handle.net/1765/129483)). In this project I analysed data about the workmen on a train maintenance workshop during the Dutch national Railwaystrike in 1903. The dataset contains for most of the workmen in 1903 their behaviour during the strike as well as demographics like their family situation, living address and economic and social position. 

Based on the data I calculated a binomial regression model explaining which motives workmen could have to participate in the strike or not. The dataset contains social networks of the workmen, based on family, neighbour and society relations. These networks explain part of the behaviour of the group.

Appendix A of the dissertation (in Dutch) explains how the dataset was constructed and on which archival sources it is based.
